                    <p>
                        I have a passion for travel, and took a gap year after high school to save and then travel Europe and South East Asia,
                        taking a trip between 26th July and 5th October (71 days). This trip was entirely self funded, and was done with my then girlfriend.
                        This was one of the best experiences of my life, and I am looking forward to traveling more once I graduate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During this trip, my Dad came and met us in Thailand, and we spent an incredible few days on a sand bar off the Thai coast diving every day on their reefs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I will be adding a selection of photos and videos by the end of the first week of August 2018.
